							<h3>MARK - AR Shoe Detection</h3>
							<p>
								Pirated Identity is a 3D indie game that my group developed over the course of a semester for CS 4455 Video Game Design at Georgia Tech.
								It is defined as a 3rd person action/shooter "game feel" game with an explorable world and story. This game achieved a high 99/100 overall
								score, one of the highest for the Fall 2018 class, and was voted "most polished" by the teaching assistants.

				<p><b><h3>Background</h3></b></p>
				<p>
					Game feel is the intangible, tactile sensation experienced when interacting with video games. The term was popularized by the book "Game Feel: A Game Designer's Guide 
					to Virtual Sensation" written by Steve Swink. The term has no formal definition, but there are many defined ways to improve game feel. The different areas of a game that 
					can be manipulated to improve game feel are: input, response, context, aesthetic, metaphor, and rules.
					<br /><br />
					Game feel is usually attributed to spatial games whose mechanics involve controlling the movement of objects or characters. Since the majority of games are spatial, studies 
					involving game feel mainly focus on the movement and physical interactions between objects in games. The goal of good game feel is to immerse the player in an engaging and 
					rewarding experience. A way to test game feel is to see if interacting with a game's most basic mechanics feels satisfying. 
					<br /><br />
				</p>
				<p><b><h3>Goal</h3></b></p>
				<p>
					During our initial brainstorming sessions, we were able to empathize what type of gameplay and story we wanted to tell. We then defined the specific gameplay elements that were
					required by the project assignment in terms of animation, art, audio, interactivity, AI, and user interface. Afterwards we started to ideate on various ideas to add to our indie game.
					<br /><br />
					</p>
					<p>
					<div class="row justify-content-center">
						<img class="img-fluid" src="img/portfolio/pi_mirror.png">
					</div>
					Our game has a clearly defined, achievable objective/goal. The playerâ€™s object is to search for their mirror identity and match its color. The protagonist has forgotten their
					color identity and must fight through a maze which their trapped identity is captured. The player does not know which color (red, blue, green) their identity is and must gather clues
					throughout the game to figure out. This is hinted at during the cutscene, 
					and also in the book instructions in the starting room. The book is placed in one of the corners of the starting room indicated by a ring of blue light. The user can press the spacebar
					to read the book. If the player reaches the reflection door without a key, a popup will indicate they need to find a key.
					<br /><br />

					Similar to my AR Tool Detection project, shoes were gathered from the team that were deemed "hype" or popular. For the purposes of time, only the left shoe
					was scanned from each pair. These included the Nike Air Max 270 React, Air Force 1 Low Types, Air Jordan IV Cool Greys, Air Max 90s, and a competitor shoe
					as shown above. All shoes were scanned through Apple's 3D Scanning app in a well lit room on a black table until the ARObjects exported were determined to be of quality.
					<br /><br />
					The development team then designed custom spritekit scene pop ups that would appear right above the shoe model. These contained a high quality retail image
					of the shoe, the shoe name, and the color scheme. Additionally, a button called "Get 'Em" was added later on that would pop up when it detected the shoe model. Clicking on it
					would lead the user to the respective product page on Nike.com where the user can then log in and immediately add the product to cart.

				<p>
					The above video is our final test in an outdoor environment. One of our team members wore a scanned shoe and then I took an iPad with our prototype app installed and
					tried hovering over the shoe for a few seconds. While a bit slower than indoor conditions, the camera detected the shoe model and overlaid the pop up screen. I then clicked
					the "GET 'EM" button that took me to the respective webpage for the Air Max 90s. A similar process was shown on stage as part of a live demo during the presentation.

					My team even had time to implement a fun easter egg that triggered when you try to scan a certain competitor's shoe :)

					There we showcase our market research of footwear revenue, detail our implementation, measure the impact we would have on Nike, as well as a future rollout strategy
					with a timeline and projected growth. Our presentation won 3rd place overall in the top 10 selected Global Technology teams!

					Overall the hackathon project was a huge success granting us the bronze title in Hack72. I was able to successfully pitch my hackathon project, have it get voted
					as one of the top 10 ideas, and lead a team of people while splitting them into sub-groups based on their strengths. The project is now published on Nike's internal
					hackathon website and will be shown to future interns for inspiration.
					<br /><br />
					This project was also a result of my prior ARkit experience from my internship with Home Depot. I expanded upon my AR Tool Detection project and extended the idea to Nike shoes.
					I was able to build on the weaknesses of my previous project and reiterate on the ideate phase. One of the new ideas was the creation of a button that took users to the customer site instead of
					overlaying the website in AR space which has proved to be a bit wonky. This led to another unique AR prototype that I'm proud to showcase.
					<br /><br />
					As augmented reality frameworks and smartphones get more powerful with every release, I can see a futre where AR will be a ubiquitous technology that's used
					more in our current mobile applications. Imagine having a database of thousands of shoes that are pre-scaned and having an implementation in the current Nike
					mobile app that allowed the user to use the camera to detect any shoe and instantly display helpful info. With ARObjects being a small file size of less
					than 2mb, we have the potential to store many point cloud models. This is also an alternative to training models with machine learning that can lead to far more accurate results.
					Nike has already put out ARKit features into production with their mobile app and SNKRs, so a feature like this isn't too far-fetched to be implemented.
