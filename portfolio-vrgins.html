				<p><b><h3>Background</h3></b></p>
				<p>
					Over time, humans have evolved the methods of learning in such ways that allow for
					accumulating more information and acquiring an overall deeper understanding of learned
					concepts. As technology continues to progress, people have begun to develop new techniques of
					learning that may span beyond the traditional canon. Soloway, Guzdial, and Hay (1994) explore
					the dawn of human computer interaction as engineers of the late twentieth century first began to
					implement new designs and interfaces that would make the computer more usable (Soloway,
					Guzdial, & Hay, 1994). Azuma (1997) defines augmented reality as a medium with three key
					elements: it combines the real and virtual, it is interactive in real time, and it is registered in three
					dimensions. This dramatic surge of interest in using virtual reality was seen in the field of
					professional education and training (Zahira 2014), which we plan to explore further into
					educational retention.
					<br><br>
					The development of immersive digital-reality experiences, such as virtual reality, calls
					for the application of these technologies to the field of education, as they create opportunities for
					the improvement of school-based learning. Virtual reality and mixed reality provide a richness of
					interaction with information that may outperform more traditional formats commonly associated
					education. With previous successful simulations done with VR technology in the aerospace,
					graphic design, and medical professional fields (Fowler 2014), and due to the ease of obtaining
					such VR equipment for the modern consumer, there is an interest to explore the effect of
					educational VR experiences on memory retention. The increased media richness of virtual reality
					may lead to higher levels of information retention and aid learning within schools.
				</p>
				<p><b><h3>Goal</h3></b></p>
				<p>
					This experiment explores the effect of media richness in educational context, specifically
					how levels of media richness affect enjoyment of learning and overall effectiveness in learning.
					Certain studies have shown that there exists relationships between media richness and learning
					(Liu, Liao, & Pratt, 2008), but no studies encompass the spectrum up to the point of virtual
					reality. In our study, there was a total of twenty participants who were randomly assigned into
					one of three different groups. Each group was assigned a different medium—either text, video,
					or virtual reality—that conveys the same information. All participants were told to study using
					their assigned medium and then given a post-test where they were assessed on their study
					material and reported their overall enjoyment of the experience. After conducting one-way
					analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests on the collected data, the results supported the proposition
					that media richness has an effect on enjoyment, but did not support the hypothesis that media
					richness has an effect on learning.
				</p>
				<p><b><h3>Process</h3></b></p>
				<p>
					This is an experiment where each group was designated to a condition of media richness
					to measure the test performance and enjoyment of that media. As a group, we formed two main 
					hypothesis that we wanted to test:

					<ul class="unordered-list">
						<li><span>Participants will experience greater enjoyment when using higher levels of media richness.</span></li>
						<li><span>Participants who study with virtual reality will perform better on the given assessment than those who study by video, and even more so than those who study with text.
						</span></li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>

					A convenience sample of twenty Georgia Tech undergraduate students enrolled in
					Research Methods were used as participants. The participants were given participation credit in
					the Research Methods class as compensation for their time. Our independent variable was the
					type of media richness, and it was manipulated into three groups: group one being a text-only
					condition, group two a video condition, and group three a VR condition. Media richness was
					measured as a between-subjects variable as participants were only assigned to one of three
					groups. Our measured dependent variables were enjoyment and test performance. Both
					dependent variables are within-subjects as every participant had the same post-test. In the post-
					test, the participants were asked to report their overall enjoyment, their interest in the material,
					and their perception of how effective it was in learning. These three ratings were summed to
					calculate their overall enjoyment of the experiment. Enjoyment was measured on an interval
					scale determining the happiness and excitement for each method of learning. Additionally, the
					post-test included questions that assessed their learning from the medium they were given. Test
					performance was measured on a ratio scale determining how accurately a participant answered
					these questions.

					Study material was based on the Titans of Space VR phone app. The premise of the app
					was a short space tour that guided users through the solar system and gave facts about each
					planet. The study content was presented to participants in one of three forms based on varying
					media richness: a transcript of the app (text), a screen recording of the app (video), and the full
					experience of the app (VR). For the VR portion, we were able to borrow Samsung Galaxy S8s
					and Utopia 360 VR headsets from the Tech Square Research Building Phone Lab, and the
					Georgia Tech Library respectively. Participants were instructed to bring their own computers and
					laptops. Google Forms was used for the entire experiment to sign consent, to distribute
					information and study materials, and to collect data.
				</p>
				<p><b><h3>Testing</h3></b></p>
					Participants were randomly assigned into three groups of media richness: text, video, or
					VR. After obtaining informed consent, they were given a pre-evaluation survey on self-perceived
					prior knowledge of the study material. The pre-test was used a covariant in our study to see if it
					had any effect on post-test performance, however our results later showed it was not relevant.
					After completing the pre-test, participants were given study materials based on their assigned
					media richness group. Group 1, text, was presented with a PDF document containing study
					material transcribed from the app. Group 2, video, was presented with a YouTube video which
					followed the VR tour but in video format. They were allowed to pause in between to study.
					Group 3, virtual reality, was given VR phone headsets and instructed to go through the entire
					application, Titans of Space VR. All participants had up to twenty minutes of study time that was
					kept consistent through all groups. After studying, participants were given an assessment on the
					study materials and a survey on enjoyment. Upon completion, they were all shown a debrief
					screen and thanked for their participation. The total experiment time was measured to be around
					30 minutes.

					We ran one-way between-subjects ANOVA tests for both hypotheses, where the
					independent variable for both was the level of media richness. For our first hypothesis, the
					dependent variable was the participants’ levels of enjoyment. We expected the VR group to have
					the highest levels of enjoyment, followed by the video group, then followed by the text group.
					The test results on our experiment data showed to be statistically significant (F(2,17) = 13.15, p
					less than .001) and supported our hypothesis. The mean enjoyment for each group was 5.50 for text,
					7.33 for video, and 11.63 for VR, as shown in the above figure.

				</div>	
				<p>
					The data for our second hypothesis was also tested using one-way between-subjects
					ANOVA tests with the same independent variable. The dependent variable for this hypothesis
					was the participants’ ratio of correct answers on the knowledge assessment post-test. We
					expected that the VR group would have the highest number of correct answers, followed by the
					video group, then followed by the text group. The test results on our experiment data showed to
					be not statistically significant (F(2,17) = .34, p = .72) and did not support our second hypothesis.
					The mean participant test performance for each group was 44% for text, 49% for video, and 53%
					for VR, as shown in the second figure above.

					Click the paper above to read our complete findings, discussion, and references.
					Our results support our first hypothesis, that study materials with higher levels of media
					richness will lead to greater levels of enjoyment while studying. When given a survey on their
					self-perceived enjoyment of studying, participants who studied with virtual reality reported
					significantly higher levels of enjoyment, as compared to video and text.
					Our second hypothesis, however, was not supported by our results. Participants who
					studied with richer media did not score significantly higher than those who studied with less rich
					media, when given an assessment on the material. This is not what we would expect when
					considering the effects of media richness theory on learning previously found by Liu, Liao, &
					Pratt (2008).
					<br /><br />
					We believe that our lack of significance may be due to a few key errors within our
					experiment. Firstly, only twenty participants took place in our study, leading to a very low
					power. When examining the average test performance of each group, we do see a general, yet not
					significant, rising trend of scores when increasing media richness, and we may find these
					differences to become more pronounced and significant simply by increasing the number of
					participants.
					Additionally, the similar characteristics of participants may have influenced the results,
					as they were conveniently selected. All participants were of a similar age, members of the same
					psychology class at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and all majoring in either computer
					science or psychology at the institute. We believe these similarities may have been too
					overbearing to allow our sample to be representative to the general population.
					<br /><br />
					Every group was also required to create a poster and present their findings to esteemed faculty at the Georgia Tech Psychology Department.
					This included multiple presentations to more than 10+ faculty members and groups of undergraduate students. Afterwards, judges voted on the
					poster they believed to be most interesting and of good quality. Our group was voted <b>*1st Place*</b> and honored by hanging the poster in
					the Psychology Department hall of fame, where all previous winning posters were up for show.

					Huge thanks goes to my fellow group members: Brittany, Dezarae, and William for helping me put my VR idea together.
					Working with undergraduates from a variety of backgrounds really pushed us to produce quality work.
					As demonstrated by this study, media richness has a significant effect on the enjoyment
					of learning. Whether or not the learning outcomes are significantly better than studying with
					traditional media, this alone should be enough to stoke the further creation of educational virtual
					reality applications. Enjoyment may lead to an increased willingness to study, and thus better
					academic outcomes within and out of school settings, and this study serves as a recommendation
					to make enjoyment a consideration when designing learning environments and developing study
					materials for classrooms of the future.
